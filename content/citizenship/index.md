### Step One
## Get Your FreeFlow Twin

<br>

Your FreeFlow Twin is your citizenship in the FreeFlow Nation. For a low cost, you can gain access to a set of sovereign digital tools and an ecosystem of like-minded individuals taking real actions to enable the world they wish to see.

### Step Two
## Connect Your Twin to the Free Zone

<br>

Your FreeFlow Twin can be connected to a personal company in a real sovereign digital free zone. Imagine the ultimate in sovereignty – a combination of legal, financial, and digital privacy.

### Step Three
## Host the FreeFlow Internet

<br>

The FreeFlow Internet is our own Internet – built by us, for all of us. By connecting a FreeFlow Node at your home or office, you can provide a new kind of Internet capacity to the people around you and be rewarded for this act of service. Support a sovereign future.
