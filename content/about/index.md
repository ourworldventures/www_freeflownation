# About

<br>

We believe in a new world where we all put the planet and people first, and everyone has equal chances. We believe that through technology we can make it happen.

## The FreeFlow Cooperative

<br>

We operate as a cooperative. In the first phase, we will still operate underneath the legal umbrella of OurWorld in Mauritius, but as we go forward, the coopereative will be established and we all become members.

<br>

The cooperative will be a globally recognized structure that enables us to effectively coordinate our collaboration across both the digital and physical realms.

## People & Planet First

<br/>

Values are the glue which hold us together. We believe that we all have a responsibility not only to each other but also to the planet which we all call our collective home.

<br/>

Anything we do or create must be done with the planet and people in mind. Are we protecting, or even better, regenerating our planet? Are we helping the people around us?

<br/>

We're all about taking quick action and turning our dreams into reality as soon as we can.

## Backed by Many

<br>

FreeFlow Nation is backed by different people and projects, who collaborate to give form to this digital nation. There is not one specific company behind.

<br/>

We work together with a Digital Free Zone (see [ourworldfreezone.com](https://ourworldfreezone.com)) to make sure all is strongly regulated and is following best practices. And we use open source technology that has been developed by ThreeFold (see [threefold.io](https://threefold.io)), which is a decentralized Internet infrastructure layer.
