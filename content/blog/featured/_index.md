## In-article heading --- it's an H2 because your title is the H1

And after another paragraph or two or three, you may want to add a subheading, which would be an H3, so it would be like the following.

### Subheading (H3)

Text here.

And here are some examples of how to use the `imgc` shortcode in `/templates/shortcodes`:

{{ imgc(path="blog//2018/10/post-1/Typography-scr-cap-2-2018-10-16.jpg", alt="Thin and dim text that is hard to read", width=1344, height=200) }}

{{ imgc(path="blog//2018/10/post-1/Typography-scr-cap-3-2018-10-16.jpg", alt="More thin and dim text that is hard to read", width=1398, height=252) }}

{{ imgc(path="blog//2018/10/post-1/Typography-scr-cap-4-2018-10-16.jpg", alt="Still more thin and dim text that is hard to read", width=1398, height=164) }}

Closing text. That ends Post 1!
