#### Today, we are ready for massive adoption.

<br>

<br>

The first phase has been focused on initial expansion and the creation of all the technology required. The next two phases are all about accelerated expansion, and this requires many billions of tokens and tens of thousands of servers. To support the accelerated expansion phase we are now launching a set of liquidity pools. Liquidity Flow Providers (LFP) power the financial system of this model, providing flow to the Internet of Internets economy. The more TFT flow, the more successful ThreeFold will become.
