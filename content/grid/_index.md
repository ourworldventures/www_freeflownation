## WE’VE COME A LONG WAY, <br> **AND WE’RE JUST GETTING STARTED**

After setting world records in Internet storage and cloud automation technologies throughout the past 20 years, some of our co-founders decided to start from scratch and build a new Internet infrastructure that is universally open source and peer-to-peer.

And we’re aiming for new heights. The People’s Internet will turn into a DAO in 2022, inviting developers and enterprises from all around the world to collaborate on the decentralization of everything that is digital, and beyond.
